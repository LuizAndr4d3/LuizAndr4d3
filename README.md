## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating robust and scalable applications. My journey in software development has led me to explore various technologies, from building RESTful APIs to developing machine learning models. I'm particularly fascinated by neural networks and their applications in solving real-world problems.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me learning about new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal projects that push my boundaries as a developer.
